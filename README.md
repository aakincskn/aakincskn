Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m AkÄ±n Coskun, a passionate economist, data scientist and data enthusiast with a strong interest in Machine Learning, Data Analysis. I love creating clean, efficient code and contributing to open-source projects.

About Me:
ðŸ“Š Data Enthusiast: Skilled in data analysis, visualization, and machine learning with tools like Pandas, Scikit-learn, numpy and Matplolib, Seaborn.

ðŸ”§ Open Source Contributor: Actively contributing to open-source projects and always looking for new opportunities to give back to the community.

ðŸŒ± Lifelong Learner: Constantly learning new technologies and improving my skill set. Iâ€™m currently diving deeper into time series forecasting, reinforcement learning, etc., exploring new algorithms, and applying them to real-world datasets. 

My Projects:

Wage_prediction_of_baseball_playeers : I made salary prediction based on baseball players' data. I compared lightgbm, catboost, randomforest algorithms and chose the best performing one. Feature engineering and data wrangling part was done at the beginning of the project.

House_Price_Prediction: I made house price prediction using the data containing the properties of the houses, I compared linear regression, KNeighborsRegresso, DecisionTreeRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor and XGBRegressor algorithms and chose the one that gives the best performance. 

Telco_churn_prediction: Churn Analysis for Telco. 

RFM_analysis_for_FLO: I operated the RFM analysis. It is an important analysis on CRM. Recency, Frequency and Monetary variables are used.
